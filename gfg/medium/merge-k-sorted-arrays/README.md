# Merge k Sorted Arrays

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given a 2D matrix  **mat[][]**  of size  **n x m**. Each row in the matrix is sorted in non-decreasing order, merge all the rows and return a single sorted array that contains all the elements of the matrix.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 3, 5, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8], [0, 9, 10, 11]]

Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
Explanation: Merging all elements from the 3 sorted arrays and sorting them results in: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
```

```
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 2, 3, 4], [5, 5, 6, 6], [7, 8, 9, 9]]

Output: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9] 
Explanation: Merging all elements from the 4 sorted arrays and sorting them results in:[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9]
```

 **Constraints** :
1 ≤ n * m ≤ 105
0 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 106

```py
class Solution:
    def mergeArrays(self, mat):
        # code here
        res = []
        n = len(mat)
        heap = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if mat[i]:
                heapq.heappush(heap,(mat[i][0],i,0))
                
        
        while heap:
            value, row, col = heapq.heappop(heap)
            res.append(value)
            
            if col + 1 < len(mat[row]):
                heapq.heappush(heap,(mat[row][col+1],row,col + 1))
                
        return res
```
