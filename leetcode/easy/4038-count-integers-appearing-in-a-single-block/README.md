# Count Integers Appearing in a Single Block

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums`.

An integer `x` is  **special**  if all occurrences of `x` in `nums` appear in a single  **contiguous**  block.

Return the number of  **distinct**  special integers in `nums`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [1,2,2,1]

 **Output:**  1

 **Explanation:** 

- 1 appears at indices 0 and 3, forming two separate blocks, so it is not special.
- 2 appears in a single contiguous block at indices [1, 2], so it is special.

Therefore, there is one special integer.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [3,3,1,2,2,1]

 **Output:**  2

 **Explanation:** 

- 3 appears in a single contiguous block at indices [0, 1], so it is special.
- 1 appears at indices 2 and 5, forming two separate blocks, so it is not special.
- 2 appears in a single contiguous block at indices [3, 4], so it is special.

Therefore, there are two special integers.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 100

        i = 0
        count = 0
        while i < len(nums):
            if nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                count += 1
            i += 1
        return count
        
                
        
```
