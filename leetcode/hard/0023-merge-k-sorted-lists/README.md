# Merge k Sorted Lists

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

 *Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.* 

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted linked list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: lists = []
Output: []

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- k == lists.length
- 0 <= k <= 104
- 0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
- -104 <= lists[i][j] <= 104
- lists[i] is sorted in ascending order.
- The sum of lists[i].length will not exceed 104.

```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
import heapq

class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: list[ListNode | None]) -> ListNode | None:
        heap = []

        for i, node in enumerate(lists):
            if node:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (node.val, i, node))

        dummy = ListNode(0)
        curr = dummy

        while heap:
            val, i, node = heapq.heappop(heap)

            curr.next = node
            curr = curr.next

            if node.next:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, i, node.next))

        return dummy.next
        
```
