# Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an `n x n` `matrix` where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, return  *the*  `kth`  *smallest element in the matrix*.

Note that it is the `kth` smallest element  **in the sorted order**, not the `kth`  **distinct**  element.

You must find a solution with a memory complexity better than `O(n2)`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8
Output: 13
Explanation: The elements in the matrix are [1,5,9,10,11,12,13,13,15], and the 8th smallest number is 13

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: matrix = [[-5]], k = 1
Output: -5

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
- 1 <= n <= 300
- -109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109
- All the rows and columns of matrix are guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order.
- 1 <= k <= n2

 

 **Follow up:** 

- Could you solve the problem with a constant memory (i.e., O(1) memory complexity)?
- Could you solve the problem in O(n) time complexity? The solution may be too advanced for an interview but you may find reading this paper fun.

                low = guess + 1
            else:
                res = guess
                high = guess - 1
